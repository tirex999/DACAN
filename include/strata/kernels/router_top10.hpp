// include/strata/kernels/router_top10.hpp - the MoE router, host-callable (P2.S2).
//
// logits (n_tokens, n_expert) -> the top-k experts per token with renormalised weights.  Semantics are
// `ref/moe.py::router`'s: softmax over ALL experts, stable descending argsort (ties break by index), gather,
// then renormalise with ggml's 2**-14 lower clamp.
//
// The BF16 GEMV that PRODUCES the logits is a separate kernel and is not here; this handles the routing only,
// which is why `logits` is taken as an f32 buffer the caller has already filled.
