// The ORDER is specified in docs/sampling.md, transcribed from llama.cpp's own chain.  Three facts there are
// easy to get backwards: temperature comes AFTER the truncation filters, penalties come AFTER temperature as
// well as before the selection, and min_p cuts BEFORE top_p (both on the pre-temperature logits).

// in the parameter names or the types says so - `const float* logits` reads exactly like a host buffer.
// Measured: passing host memory for `logits` faults inside the kernel with an ILLEGAL MEMORY ACCESS that is
// reported by whatever synchronising call happens NEXT, which will be somewhere else entirely and will name a
// buffer that has nothing to do with it.  A sticky async fault does not know where it came from.
//
// `history` is (n_tokens, history_len) int32, the most recent tokens for each row with any unused slots set to
// -1; only the last `p.penalty_last_n` of each row are counted.  Pass nullptr and 0 when no penalties apply.
