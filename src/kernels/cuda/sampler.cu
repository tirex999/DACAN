// src/kernels/cuda/sampler.cu - P2.S2: the sampler chain, in the order docs/sampling.md settles.
//
//     penalties  ->  top_k  ->  top_p  ->  temperature  ->  pick
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE CONTENT OF THIS FILE.  `docs/sampling.md` transcribes it from llama.cpp's own chain
// (`common/sampling.cpp` L357/360/375/381/399) and the two facts that are easy to get backwards are that
// TEMPERATURE COMES AFTER THE TRUNCATION FILTERS and PENALTIES COME AFTER TEMPERATURE.  The intuitive order -
// scale first, then truncate, with penalties as pre-processing - is a different distribution.  Both produce a
// valid token, so only a comparison at the distribution level can tell them apart; the parity test does that
// explicitly by running the wrong order and requiring it to differ.
//
// 27.09.2026: `SamplerParams::temp_first` is the OTHER order on purpose - top_p's mass at temperature T, as vLLM,
// SGLang / flashinfer and HF compute it.  An OpenAI-style request ("temperature 0.6, top_p 0.95, top_k 20", Qwen's
// card) means that order, so the server asks for it; the llama.cpp chain stays the default of the kernel.
//
// Everything happens on the logits of ONE token in one thread.  The vocab is 248,320, which is far too large
// to sort per token on a naive path, so `top_k` uses `k` passes of a maximum scan - 20 x 248,320 = 5.0M
// comparisons per token.  Phase 3's note ("sort-free sampler: top-k = 20 makes this easy") is the optimisation;
// this is the correctness version.

/// The obvious repair is to parallelise the scan inside `sampler_kernel`, and it is WRONG: with one thread
/// per token, a block reduction over the vocabulary has nothing to reduce, and the threads that returned

/// **THE TIE RULE IS UNCHANGED AND THAT IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT.**  The serial scan walked `v`
/// ascending with `if (s > bv)`, so the LOWEST index wins a tie.  Each thread keeps that rule over its own
