// src/kernels/cuda/router_top10.cu - P2.S2: the MoE router.
//
// P2.S2's spec: "BF16 GEMV, softmax / top-k / renormalize per docs/semantics.md; emits (expert_id, weight) x 10
// per token".  This is the softmax/top-k/renormalize half; the BF16 GEMV that produces the logits is a
// separate kernel and is NOT here.
//
// The semantics are transcribed from `ref/moe.py::router`, which is itself transcribed from llama-graph.cpp:
//
//     p   = softmax(logits)                       over ALL experts, not over the selected subset
//     ids = stable argsort(-p)[:k]                ties break by INDEX, ascending
//     w   = gather(p, ids)
//     s   = max(sum(w), 2**-14)                   ggml_clamp(..., 2**-14, INF)
//     return ids, w / s
//
// The two-step structure matters and is not cosmetic: computing softmax over the selected subset instead is
// mathematically identical (softmax is shift-invariant) but it moves the renormalisation, and the CLAMP is
// part of the renormalisation.  Reproducing the gather form is what makes the clamp land in the same place.
//
// WHY THIS IS NO LONGER "NAIVE BY DESIGN", AND WHAT THE OLD REASONING GOT WRONG.
//
// The first version was ONE THREAD PER TOKEN: k passes over the experts, each pass recomputing
// `exp((double) l[e] - mx)` for every expert.  Its comment justified that with
//
//     "5,120 operations per token against 2.36e9 weights of expert matvec - three orders of magnitude smaller
//      than the thing it feeds, so the simplest correct version is also fast enough"
//
// **That is a statement about OPERATION COUNT and it says nothing about TIME, because all 5,120 operations were
// on ONE THREAD while the matvec has thousands.**  Measured (round 218, stage-by-stage inside one block):
//
//     moe_layer   4.077 ms      router_top10   3.387 ms      bf16 gemv   0.270 ms
//
// 3.39 ms per layer x 48 layers = 163 ms of a 289 ms token - **56% of the whole forward pass, in a kernel that
// reads 2.6 MB.**  It was invisible in `router_top10_parity` because that test runs the kernel ONCE and checks
// the right ids, and invisible in every per-layer test for the same reason.
//
// WHAT IS PARALLELISED AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT:
//
//   * the MAX is a tree reduction of `fmaxf`, which is exact and order-independent - bit-identical to the
//     serial scan it replaces;
//   * the 512 EXPONENTIALS are computed ONCE each, in parallel.  The old kernel computed them ELEVEN TIMES
//     (once for the softmax, then again inside every one of the k passes).  This is where the 3.4 ms was;
//   * the DOUBLE SUM is still accumulated on ONE thread in ASCENDING order.  512 double adds is about a
//     microsecond and it keeps the accumulation order - and therefore the last bits - identical to the
//     reference-faithful serial version.  Parallelising it would be a free speedup and a silent change to the
//     values, and the exp was the cost, not this;
//   * the SELECTION is by RANK rather than by k repeated maxima:
//
//         rank(e) = #{ f : p[f] > p[e] }  +  #{ f < e : p[f] == p[e] }
//
//     which IS "stable descending argsort, ties by ascending index" - the same order the repeated-maximum loop
//     produced - computed in ONE parallel pass over the experts instead of k serial ones.  It is O(n^2)
//     comparisons and that is the right trade here: n = 512, every comparison is independent, and the old
//     version was O(k*n) with a serial `exp` inside.
